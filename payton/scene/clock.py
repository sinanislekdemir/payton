    """Clock thread

    Clock is a time-based thread which triggers the callback function
    in given intervals.

    Some use cases:
    * Get the object states every n microseconds and log them
    * Animate an object (move the object every 1/24 seconds)
    * Create an AI that scans the entire surroumdings regularly

    Best use case is to use it as a global timer in the whole scene
    with a single Clock.

    Due to GIL in Python Interpreter, try to keep the number of clocks as
    low as possible to prevent each clock to get in the way of main
    render cycle. Many clocks would probably create a lag in the scene.

    For example, you can have 10 AI bots in the scene.
    Create a single clock that loops and makes a decision for each bot
    instead of creating separate clocks for each bot.

Personally, I don't really read long descriptive documentation unless necessary. I prefer things simple and self-explanatory. Therefore, instead of writing lengthy documentation, I create simple examples to demonstrate each feature of Payton without requiring deep dives into the internals.

Examples can be downloaded from the [Payton Github Page](https://github.com/sinanislekdemir/payton/tree/master/examples).

You can either download the entire repository [as a zip file](https://github.com/sinanislekdemir/payton/archive/master.zip) or you can simply `git clone` it.

## ðŸŽ­ Motion Capture Data

Payton includes support for BVH (Biovision Hierarchy) motion capture files. For extensive motion capture datasets, you can find thousands of BVH files from the [Bandai Namco Research Motion Dataset](https://github.com/BandaiNamcoResearchInc/Bandai-Namco-Research-Motiondataset). The example BVH files included with Payton are sourced from this dataset.

Payton is a 3D Software Development Kit designed as a general-purpose playground for programming. With Payton, users can quickly kickstart their ideas and create tools for next-level development, including map editors, small animations, algorithms, or artificial intelligence for games. Unlike complex game engines and libraries that can be time-consuming to set up, Payton comes with sensible pre-configured defaults, making it unique and simple to use.

Payton is not intended to be a full-featured game engine or complete 3D environment, as there are already plenty of excellent tools available for those purposes. Instead, it excels at rapid prototyping and tool development, allowing users to easily visualize their concepts and achieve their goals. Users can seamlessly transition from Payton to other platforms when their projects outgrow its scope.

While 2D graphs and charts are useful for reports, many scenarios require visualizing data in 3 or 4 dimensions. Payton enables users to extend their graphics into higher dimensions and process real-time data from sensors, cameras, or any other data source. These sources can include thermometers, random number generators, IoT devices with speed sensors, maps, vehicle diagnostic ports, or even time-based mathematical formulas. Although projects can become complex, Payton is designed to remain accessible to beginners who can follow the tutorials to develop their programming skills.

## Install

### Requirements:

- LibSDL2 `sudo apt install libsdl2-dev` for Debian/Ubuntu-based Linux distributions. For other platforms, please consult your preferred package manager.
- ImageMagick `sudo apt install imagemagick` for Debian/Ubuntu-based Linux distributions. For other platforms, please consult your preferred package manager.
- Python 3.10+
- A graphics card that supports OpenGL 3.3+

### Install using Pip:

From a bash terminal:
```bash
pip install payton
```

This should install all dependencies. If you encounter permission errors, you are likely installing the library system-wide and may be missing some permissions. If you prefer not to use pipenv or virtualenv, you might want to run the above command as `sudo pip3 install payton`.

### Optional Bullet Physics Integration

Payton supports Bullet Physics at a basic level for solid geometries.

```bash
pip install pybullet
```

Once Bullet Physics is successfully installed in the same environment as Payton, it will be automatically activated, and you will be able to use its basic properties.
Check out the relevant examples.

### Optional GTK3 Integration

Instead of SDL2, you can use GTK3 (along with all nice GTK3 widgets) with Payton.
![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sinanislekdemir/payton/assets/assets/gtk3.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sinanislekdemir/payton/assets/assets/gtk3.png)

You need to [install Python GTK3 Bindings](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html).

#### AWP3D Format and Exporter

AWP3D is simply a ZIP file containing every frame as a Wavefront object. To export your animated Blender objects as AWP3D files, you can use the exporter add-on available here:

[https://github.com/sinanislekdemir/payton/tree/master/plugins](https://github.com/sinanislekdemir/payton/tree/master/plugins)

#### Using Payton with Anaconda

As of version `0.0.10`, Payton is installable on Anaconda. From the Anaconda Prompt:

```bash
pip install payton
```

This is sufficient to install Payton and its dependencies on Anaconda.

Payton will be available for use with Spyder or JupyterLab locally.

### Upgrade to the latest version:

Payton is under active maintenance. This means I am spending time fixing bugs and making improvements. Therefore, you might want to upgrade it occasionally.

    pip3 install payton --upgrade
    
This should do the trick!

## Getting Started

### Your first code

```python
from payton.scene import Scene

scene = Scene()
scene.run()
```

This will create your first empty scene and show it inside an SDL window.

## Controls

| Key / Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Mouse Wheel | Zoom In - Zoom Out|
| Right Mouse Button Drag | Rotate Scene |
| Middle Mouse Button Drag | Pan Scene |
| Escape | Quit Simulation |
| C | Change Camera Mode (Perspective / Orthographic) |
| Space | UnPause / Pause Scene Clocks |
| G | Show / Hide Grid |
| W | Change Display Mode (Solid / Wireframe / Points) |
| F2 | Previous Camera |
| F3 | Next Camera |
| H | Open / Close Help Window |

## Environment variables

Some options can be configured using environment variables.

- `SDL_WINDOW_WIDTH`: Set window width.
- `SDL_WINDOW_HEIGHT`: Set window height.
- `GL_MULTISAMPLEBUFFERS`: Set OpenGL multisample buffer count for antialiasing. (usually 1 or 2)
- `GL_MULTISAMPLESAMPLES`: Set OpenGL multisample sampling count for antialiasing. (usually 1-16)

Without `GL_MULTISAMPLEBUFFERS` AND `GL_MULTISAMPLESAMPLES`, you may notice pixelated graphics. There are no default values set for these because they can vary between graphics cards.

## Troubleshooting

On some older systems or where decent graphics drivers are not installed, you can try running Payton code with MESA. It runs fine, though there will be some performance decrease. However, this will not be noticeable for basic applications.

To enforce MESA 3.3, you can run Payton with:

```
MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.3 python <path-to-your-payton-code>
```

## Examples

Personally, I donâ€™t really read the long descriptive documentation unless necessary. I like things simple and self-explaining. Therefore, instead of writing long documentations, I write simple examples to use each feature of Payton without digging much into the internals.

Examples can be downloaded from [Payton Github Page](https://github.com/sinanislekdemir/payton/tree/master/examples).

## Contribution

* Please keep using type hints in the main library.
* Type hinting can be ignored for examples.
* Example code should be plain and simple.
* Every new feature should include sensible defaults.
  * Nothing should be too verbose to use.
* Make sure that `make check` passes before pushing your code.
* Running `isort .` is not mandatory but highly encouraged.
* Every new feature should have example code.
* There is a reason why some methods are longer than they should be and complex.
  * To reduce code jumps and stack switches.
  * To run faster.

## Some free thoughts and decisions:

I've chosen to use `List[float]` type for Vectors because:

* I needed something mutable. Otherwise, the number of memory copies and swaps would be too much. So, I've ruled out `Tuple` and `NamedTuple`.
* `dataclass` has overhead when converting to C-type floats and arrays in memory.

So, to gain some performance, I have created the main library with the risk of non-strict vector lengths.
